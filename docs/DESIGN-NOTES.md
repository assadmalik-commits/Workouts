# Design notes

Reasoning behind where this app is going, and why the order is what it is.
Written 31 August 2026 at v6.0; the scope decision below settled 1 September
at v6.5.

## Scope: one lifter, no distribution

**Decided.** This is Assad's log, used daily by Assad, and nobody else. App
stores, accounts and multi-device sync are deferred until that changes — which
it may never.

This is not a limitation, it is the thing that makes the app good. It removes
the tension that ran through the earlier version of this note: that every
generalising feature walks toward the crowded end of the market and away from
what makes this app unusual. There is no market. Features are judged on
whether one lifter wants them, which is a far easier question to answer and a
far better app to use.

What that drops: accounts, a backend, sync, App Review, a privacy policy, a
data-deletion flow, crash reporting, support. None of it is needed to log a
workout.

What survives, and why, is below.

## Where it stands

A single-user, opinionated log for one fixed programme: six sessions (Push,
Pull, Legs × A/B), Sunday to Friday, Saturday rest, rotation resetting each
Sunday. It enforces that programme rather than accommodating any programme —
you cannot repeat a session you have already trained this week, and correcting
an earlier day is deliberate, through the calendar.

It has no server. The published page is the database: it rewrites itself with
the log embedded in it.

## Next: stable exercise IDs

**Do this before anything else that touches exercises.**

Every log entry is keyed by the exercise's *name string*. Renaming one
exercise — `Deficit Push-Ups / Weighted Dips` to `Deficit Push-Ups` — needed a
`RENAMED` migration map plus a separate fix so entries under a name the program
no longer has still appear on screen. Before that fix, renaming stranded the
sets: they stayed in the record, still counted the session as trained, and were
visible nowhere.

This was first argued as groundwork for letting *users* choose exercises. That
argument is gone with the scope decision, and it was the weaker one anyway. The
real driver is the lifter renaming his own exercises: six renames in the first
week of use, each needing a `RENAMED` entry, and one orphan bug that had to be
fixed before a rename stopped hiding the sets logged under the old name.

That happens at one user exactly as it happens at a thousand.

The fix: exercises get stable IDs; names become display-only; logs reference
IDs. It is cheap now — one user, one week of data — and gets steadily more
expensive.

## Then: a PWA, for the lifter and not for a store

Add-to-home-screen, offline, no review, no fee. Worth doing on its own merits,
not as a step toward distribution:

- A real icon, set by the app rather than borrowed from the page that hosts it.
  While the log lives as an artifact, the home-screen icon is whatever
  claude.ai's page provides; the only lever is an emoji, and a wordmark needs a
  Shortcuts workaround.
- Full screen, without a browser address bar taking a strip of a 440px phone.
- **It removes the publish-reload entirely.** Saving currently republishes the
  page, and publishing reloads every open view — which is what threw the lifter
  onto the next day mid-session on 1 September. On its own hosting there is no
  publish, so there is no reload.

That third point is the strongest reason and was not obvious until the bug
turned up in use.

If the store question ever returns: it is not mostly a coding problem. A
Capacitor wrapper is days; the rest is everything listed under the scope
decision above. Check the current fees and review rules directly — they
change.

## Later, judged only on whether one lifter wants them

### Exercise dropdown per muscle group

Needs the ID work first. With one user the library can simply be
user-extensible — there is nobody else's duplicates to worry about.

### Choosing a 4, 5 or 6-day split

Bigger than it looks. The rotation is currently constants — `ROTATION`,
`SCHEDULE`, `REST_DOW`, the seven-cell week strip, the `x/6` counter, the
Sunday reset. Making it variable means the rotation becomes data. That is a
clean refactor, but it touches the locking, the rest-day logic and the strip.

The harder part is history: if August was six-day and September is five-day,
past sessions must still render under the programme that was live then. So
programmes need versioning, and logs need to point at the programme they belong
to. That, not the picker, is the work.

Monthly is the wrong cadence. Training blocks run 4–12 weeks, and a month
boundary lands mid-week against a Sunday reset. Prefer a programme with a start
date, switched when the lifter chooses.

### User profile

Mostly moot now. Bodyweight is already tracked. Units, available equipment and
a programme start date would earn their place as *settings*; there is no second
user for a profile to distinguish.

## Tried and removed — do not re-propose without asking

**A progression prompt** (`3 sets · max 14kg · ready to add weight`, plus a
matching cue inside the exercise). The rule was sound — double progression, hold
the weight until every prescribed set reaches the top of its rep range — and it
worked. It was removed at v6.0 because in use it was clutter and got in the way
of editing a session.

The lesson was about how it arrived: the question was "what do I do with this
number?", which wanted an explanation, and it was answered with a feature.
Clarify before building.
